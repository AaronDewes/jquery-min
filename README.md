# cleanQuery.js

A fork of jQuery which removes deprecated functions and IE support to reduce code size and increase speed.

Cleanquery differs from jQuery by

- Fully dropping IE support
- No longer registering as an AMD module
- Removing deprecated methods
- Updateing build dependencies

### Planned changes

- [ ] Migrate to ES6
- [ ] Use TypeScript
- [ ] Stop using Grunt
